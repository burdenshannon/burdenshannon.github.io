		<h3>Shannon Burden - Maid of Honor</h3>
		<p>Shannon has been #blessed to know Cait since they were about 11 years old in gym class together. A job as an Account Manager at an email marketing company brought her to San Francisco, CA, but she makes sure to text her long-distance bestie at least 45 times a day. Hobbies include hiking up and down the Bay, quoting Leslie Knope, and eating cheese (although a doctor told her it was bad for her).</p>

		<h3>Catherine Campa - Bridesmaid</h3>
		<p>Catherine is literally the girl next door...meaning she's been Cait's neighbor for almost a quarter of a century! Throughout their years growing up together in Levittown, NY, they shared dolls, laughs, playdates and now, they share pretty much all those same things + work tips - Catherine is a licensed speech therapist too!</p>

		<h3>Victoria Carson - Bridesmaid</h3>
		<p>As one of Cait's amazing cousins, Victoria has been around through it all! Originally from the Jersey Shore, Victoria currently resides in Orlando, Florida, with the big mouse as her boss - at Disney World! She'll be working at Animal Kingdom until May 2017, with hopes to move to Washington, D.C. as an event coordinator afterwards.</p>

		<h3>Natalie Cosgrove - Bridesmaid</h3>
		<p>The dynamic partner in crime of Cait's, Natalie lives in New York City and loves bacon. One time, she joined the cross country team, although she really didn't like running. But it was a great excuse to chill with Caitlyn and drink smoothies after practice!</p>

		<h3>Christine Henderson - Bridesmaid</h3>
		<p>Described by the groom as "delightfully delusional, sometimes morbidly skeptical", Christine is Eric's (favorite) sister. She lives in Queens, NY, and shapes the minds of the future leaders of the world! She's stoked to officially make Caitlyn a part of her family, although it's felt that way since Day 1.</p>

		<h3>Amanda Kerbein - Bridesmaid</h3>
		<p>Amanda lives in Cohoes, NY, and works at a preschool as a speech pathologist, singing, coloring and helping little kiddos develop their language skills. Amanda met Caitlyn during a freshman phonetics class at the College of Saint Rose. Their friendship blossomed when Amanda ended up being Cait's RA - but it wasn't all rules and curfews; Amanda and Caitlyn bonded over pickle back shots on Halloween!</p>

		<h3>Melissa Schuck - Bridesmaid</h3>
		<p>A production artist living in Carle Place, NY, Melissa became close with Caitlyn through a mutual friend - but Caitlyn's known her fianc&eacute;, John, since high school. Cait shares her love of Disney and running with Melissa - she's actually run 7 half marathons!</p>
